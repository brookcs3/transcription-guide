Given the attached image, and

- Host A converts analog to digital at a = 42 Kbps
- Link transmission rate R = 1.2 Mbps
- Host A groups data into packets of length L = 96 bytes
- Distance to travel d = 867.4 km
- Propagation speed s = 2.5 x 108 m/s
- Host A sends each packet to Host B as soon as it gathers a whole packet.
- Host B converts back from digital to analog as soon as it receives a whole packet.

How much time elapses from when the first bit starts to be created until the conversion back to analog begins? Give answer in milliseconds (ms) to two decimal places, normal rounding, without units (e.g. 1.5623 ms would be entered as "1.56" without the quotes)

Question 12****

Given a transmission medium with propagation rate of 2.5x108 m/sec. Multiple computers share this link using packet switching.

- Assume that queuing is necessary only for transmission. (i.e. **ignore processing delay for all packets.**)  
- Assume that there is no other traffic on the medium, no switches between the link and the destination
- At least 20 packets arrive in the queue at time t = 0.
- Each packet's size is 1500 bytes.
- The distance to the destination is 2500 km.

  - Packet Payload Size = 1000 Bytes
  - Packet Header Size = 24 Bytes (overhead)
- Ignore Processing and Queueing delays
- Assume partial packets (packets consisting of less than 1000 Bytes of data) are padded so that they are the same size as full packets.
- Assume continuous alternating-packet transmission.
- Computer X gets the transmission medium first.

At what time (t = ?) would *F**ileY* finish transmitting?
