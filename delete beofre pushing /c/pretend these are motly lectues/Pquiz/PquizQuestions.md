Question 22****

Given a link with a maximum transmission rate of 32.8 Mbps. Only two computers, X and Y, wish to transmit starting at time t = 0 seconds. Computer X sends ***fileX*** (4 MiB) and computer Y sends ***fileY*** (244 KiB), both starting at time t = 0.

- Statistical multiplexing is used, with details as follows
  - Packet Payload Size = 1000 Bytes
  - Packet Header Size = 24 Bytes (overhead)
- Ignore Processing and Queueing delays
- Assume partial packets (packets consisting of less than 1000 Bytes of data) are padded so that they are the same size as full packets.
- Assume continuous alternating-packet transmission.
- Computer X gets the transmission medium first.

At what time (t = ?) would *F**ileY* finish transmitting?
