In this lecture, we will focus on the network core and the fundamentalapproaches to data transfer on the Internet. There are two techniques -where one has replaced the other. However, understanding the strengthsand weaknesses of both approaches is crucial for appreciating thehistorical development and current state of communication networks. Let's provide a recap of what network core is. The network core iscomposed of multiple routers and switches that are interconnected to forma complex mesh or web-like structure. This mesh topology is fundamentalto the functioning of the Internet and is crucial for data transmission. Now, here we come with the fundamental question - "how is datatransmitted through the network?" The answer today is packet switching,simple! But it is not always the way. In the early years of networking, circuitswitching was a common method. It is often associated with traditionaltelephone networks, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). In circuit switching, a dedicated communication path, or circuit, isestablished between two devices for the duration of their conversation.While circuit switching provides a constant, predictable connection, itties up resources even when there is no actual data being transmitted.This inefficiency led to the development of more flexible and efficientmethods like packet switching.Packet switching is the predominant method used in modern computernetworks, including the Internet. In packet Data is broken into smallerpackets before transmission. Each packet is then independently routedthrough the network to reach its destination. Unlike circuit switching,packet switching allows multiple communication streams to share the samenetwork infrastructure concurrently. Routers and switches play a crucialrole in packet switching by determining the optimal path for each packetbased on destination addresses.More on circuit switching. In circuit switching, the division of bandwidth into pieces, enablingmultiple communication channels to share the same medium withoutinterference.  With circuit switching in terms of network utilization isimportant to note that circuit switching can be wasteful. A circuit orcall may be set up even if the two hosts that are talking have nothing totransfer. Now let’s talk about bandwidth division. Two common techniques forachieving this division are Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) andTime Division Multiplexing (TDM). Let's explore these concepts:FDM divides the available bandwidth into multiple frequency bands orchannels. Each communication channel is assigned a specific frequencyrange, allowing multiple channels to coexist without interference. Wherein TDM, it divides the available time into discrete time slots so thatEach communication channel is allocated a specific time slot during whichit can transmit data.Let's work on a numerical example. We have to find out How long does ittake to send a file of 80 KiB (Kibi or Kilo bytes) from host A to host Bover a circuit-switched network? And we are given that the link’stransmission rate = 1.5 Mbps and Each link uses TDM with 24 slots/sec andfinally it takes 500 ms to establish end-to-end circuit.Please watch the watch the K, Ki and s, m when you solve such a problem.Let's review the steps and calculations: At first Convert File Size toKilobits: 80KiB is equal to (80 times 2^10 Bytes) times (8 bits per Byte)= 655.36 Kb. Now since there are 24 timeslots in the TDM, one circuitwill get 1 over 24 of the total bandwidth which is (1.5 Mbps) divided by24 = 62.5 Kbps. Finally, we calculate the total transmission time as thetime to transmit the entire file (file size/ transmission rate orbandwidth) + the set-up time.  it takes approximately 11 seconds to senda file of 80 KiB from host A to host B over the circuit-switched network,considering the transmission rate, TDM, and circuit establishment time. Now the question is what would be different if we use FDM instead of TDM? Let the network is FDM, with 11 permitted users, each with an equalbandwidth share. The only change will be here when we calculate bandwidthallocated to a single user. That is, the total bandwidth over number ofusers which is 11 here. Okay! Here on this slide, we provide a concise summary of the pros andcons of a circuit-switched network. The pro is that it ensures apredictable and guaranteed level of performance for the establishedconnection, offers reliable data transmission with low latency andminimal risk of packet loss, features a straightforward andeasy-to-implement mechanism and enables high-speed data transfer once thededicated circuit is established. Whereas the cons are that it leads tounderutilization of network resources as dedicated resources remainreserved even during inactivity. Involves a setup phase, introducingoverhead and delays in initiating communication. And it Faces scalabilitychallenges due to limitations on the number of simultaneous connectionsthat can be supported.Now the fact is that Packet switching has almost completely replacedcircuit switching on the Internet. With packet switching, we have betterutilization and less waste. In packet switching, all streams sharenetwork resources, and Each packet can use the full link bandwidth.  butthe problem is we can have packets queuing, waiting for link, we can havepackets lost if demand exceeds resources. So once again packet switching involves breaking down a large chunk ofdata into smaller packets for transmission. Each packet containsessential delivery information, allowing independent travel through thenetwork.  If one packet is lost, only that specific packet needsretransmission, not the entire dataset. The capability for packets tofollow different paths enhances efficiency and reliability in datatransmission.Let's talk about some functions of packet switch networks. The thing tonotice here is that the core of the Internet (means routers and switches)functions as a store-and-forward service, requiring no knowledge ofpacket contents. At the network edges, packets are constructed, encoded,and later unpacked and decoded at their destination. So, in a little more detail, packet switching accomplishes two keyfunctions in the network core, in the network core, mainly routingalgorithms determine the path that data packets should take through thenetwork, and forwarding is the actual implementation of that path bymoving packets from one router to another until they reach theirdestination.The network core also performs other functions such as queuing thepackets, discovering the best possible routes, traffic congestioncontrol, retransmitting loss packets, determining the different types ofdata that need to go through connectionless and connected types ofservices. Some of these functions are performed with every packet sentand some are not. Some are performed out of band such as route discovery.Here we provide the pros and cons of packet switching networks. packetswitching can offer Efficient use of network resources without dedicatedcircuits. It’s Dynamic and flexible nature avoids issues with connectionblocking. and it also offers Immediate data transmission without setuptime overhead. and finally, it’s Enhanced fault tolerance and recoverymechanisms improve network resilience. The cons in packet switchingnetworks are that there is Lack of assured performance levels for datatransmission. Also, there can be Overhead introduced by packet headersmay impact overall efficiency. Finally, there can be Potential delays indata transmission due to packet-switching processes.Here we provide the summary of this lecture! Thank you!
