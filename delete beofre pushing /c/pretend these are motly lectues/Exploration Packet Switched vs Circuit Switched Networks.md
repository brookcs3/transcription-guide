# Exploration: Packet Switched vs Circuit Switched Networks

## Introduction

Which switching technology gives better performance, and in which circumstances? In this lesson we take a deeper-dive into the core concepts of switching and **multiplexing**.

**Statistical Multiplexing** refers to the way in which packet-switched networks share network resources. In the image below, two internet hosts want to send byte-stream data to a remote host. The data is broken up into packets. These packets arrive at a router and are **multiplexed** (mixed together in a sending queue). They are then sent out in the order they were received. When they arrive at the destination, they are delivered to the correct host and **De-multiplexed** (separated out and recombined into the original byte stream).

**Multiplexing** means to combine, or mix-together. **De-multiplexing** means to separate out again.

For more on multiplexing, network utilization, and a comparison of packet switching and circuit switching, be sure to watch the video lecture below. Then take the Self-Check exercises to test your knowledge.
