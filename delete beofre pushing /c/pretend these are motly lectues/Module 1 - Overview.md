# Module 1 - Overview

## Introduction

This week's focus is on laying the groundwork for understanding networking concepts. We will explore basic definitions, networking complexity, the growth of the internet, network standards and metrics, service models, network structure, protocols, circuit-switching and packet-switching, and multiplexing techniques of circuit and packet switching. We will also learn about various network performance metrics. This will include identifying and analyzing the different types of packet delay in packet-switched networks (CLO 1). You will do the required reading, complete the "Module 1 Summary Exercises" and begin working on "Wireshark Lab 1 - Introduction to Wireshark". 

## Module Learning Outcomes

After successful completion of this module, you should be able to do the following:

1. You will be able to define the following basic concepts:
   - Protocols, Network Architecture (Edge/Core)
2. You will be able to define and calculate simple Networking Metrics such as:
   - Units of measurement for data storage and transmission
   - The time required to transmit data between Network nodes
3. You will be able to define some characteristics of the following Protocols:
   - The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
   - The User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
4. You can describe the main components of Network Architecture (Internet):
   - The types of devices that populate the Network Edge
   - The types of devices that populate the Network Core
   - The types of links that wire the Network together
5. You will be able to differentiate between and describe Circuit-switching and Packet-switching and answer the following questions:
   - How is data transferred with these two methods?
   - What are the strengths and weaknesses of both methods?
   - Which of these methods are used in the Internet?
