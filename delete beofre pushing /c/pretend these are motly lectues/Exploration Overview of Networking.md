# Exploration: Overview of Networking

## Introduction

**Protocols** are a key concept in networking. But just what is a protocol? In the simplest terms, a protocol defines two things:

1. format and order of messages sent and received among network entities
2. actions taken on message transmission and receipt

In other words, a protocol allows network entities to talk to one another in a defined manner. We will see much more of protocols in upcoming weeks.

Letâ€™s talk about **network structure**. In the diagram below, we see that all of our familiar devices that access the internet occupy the **network edge**. The network edge also includes the website servers and cloud data centers. The **network core**, on the other hand, is made up of many routers and switches. The network core and the network edge are all connected by physical media. The **physical media** include copper wire, optical fiber, wireless, and more.

- network edge

  hosts and applications

  clients and servers

- network core

  interconnected routers

  network of networks

- physical media

  communication links
