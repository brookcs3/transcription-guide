Question 2****

How long did it take from when the HTTP GET message was sent until the HTTP OK reply was received? 

By default, the value of the Time column in the packet-listing window is the amount of time, in seconds, since Wireshark tracing began. 

Enter your answer in the form of "0.*xyz*" (without quotes) where *xyz* are the three first decimal places (in subseconds) of the HTTP response time. Calculate your answer using the six decimal places of subsecond time precision, and then enter your answer rounded (not truncated) to three subsecond decimal places, 0.*xyz*:
