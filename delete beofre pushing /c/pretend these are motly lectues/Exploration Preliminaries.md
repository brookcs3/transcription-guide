# Exploration: Preliminaries

## Introduction

Letâ€™s talk about Networking. Networking is a really complex subject! There are years of training in: Hardware, algorithms, applications, administration, protocols, encryption, security, wireless, and much more. All of these are being developed and improved all the time. There are many standards and protocols, old and new systems and software. Terminology can be confusing. Finally, wireless and mobility add more layers of complexity.

How will we approach the complexity of learning Networking? In this course we will concentrate on abstractions and concepts. We will use example technologies to illustrate the concepts. We will also use hands-on lab experience to reinforce the concepts.

This course will mostly focus on the technologies used by the internet. Let's pause briefly and reacquaint ourselves with this amazing phenomenon that we all take for granted.

- Network

  A network is a system that connects computers or other devices, allowing them to communicate and share resources. It involves the use of a single transmission technology, which can include wired or wireless connections.

- Internet

  The Internet is a global system of interconnected networks. It is a vast network of networks that are connected by routers. These networks are configured to communicate among a variety of network transmission technologies. The Internet enables the exchange of information and data on a global scale.In essence, the Internet is often described as a *network of networks*, highlighting its decentralized and interconnected nature. It allows for the seamless flow of information across diverse technologies and geographies.

  What is the history of the Internet and its technologies? Who administers the Internet? For answers to these questions and more be sure to watch the video lecture below, then test your knowledge with the self-check exercises.

Also, be sure to check out the Resources at the end of the pages. There will sometimes be something cool and interesting to check out.
