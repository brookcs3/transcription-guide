Okay, welcome back.  I hope that you enjoyed the first set of readings from Junxa.  I really love this text.  I think it's just, it's a lot of fun, it's playful, it's also deeply kind of irreverent.  And in general, it's also a really difficult text to wrap our heads around and to sort of  really understand what Junxa is really trying to get out.  Okay, so I hope you enjoyed the first round with it.  The second time through our second set of readings, which I want you to do now, what  I really want you to focus on is this figure of the sage.  Okay, Junxa tells a lot of stories and in these stories, there's often a sort of heroic  individual who does everything right and, you know, he's sort of perfect at whatever  his task is, whatever it is that he's trying to do in the text.  And that is the sage, okay, this sort of almost inhumanly wise person who understands  everything.  Okay, so I want you to think about what actually is a sage.  What does a sage do?  And how does maybe, how does one become a sage?  But also just sort of a question of like there are different ways of being perfect, right?  What is a sage?  And what does a sage think about issues like death?  Does a sage care about death?  What does a sage think about Confucian virtue?  Does a sage care about whether sons are properly filial towards their fathers?  So think about these kinds of questions, right?  Again, take the figure of the sage seriously.  I don't want you to just sort of read it as some kind of caricature of a wise person.  Think about it for real.  Assume that Joxa is really trying to teach us something of consequence.  And see what you find, okay, talk to you soon.
