## Topic

I feel like there is a tension in this text between a vision in which being a sage is primarily mental (think in the right way) and one in which it is primarily physical (do / eat / breathe the right way).  Which vision do you think Zhuangzi favors?  Or does he split the difference somehow?

**Due at Midnight on the Sunday at the end of Week 1.**

## Instructions

Each day, students should write two discussion posts.

The first is a response to the primary prompt. As the rubric (below) makes clear, these discussion posts should be substantial. Generally speaking, they should be *two to three paragraphs long*, and should delve into and develop one or more specific arguments. Simply paraphrasing or repeating the ideas found in the reading is not sufficient. Your posts should contain your own critical analysis of that material, guided by the question asked in the prompt. Note that you will not be able to see other students’ posts until you have uploaded your own.

The second post is a thoughtful response to another student’s post. This second post does not need to be as substantial as the first post. A short paragraph is sufficient, though you should say more than “Good point!” Please take the time to read and reflect on how other students replied to the prompt. It is fine to disagree with another student’s analysis, but please make sure that you remain respectful even when you make critical comments.
