- - - ## Introduction to Daoism Part 2
  
      The readings for this module are comprised of the second half of Zhuangzi’s work. Not surprisingly, the themes found in these chapters echo those of the chapters read for the previous module.
      
      Now that you have a basic familiarity with Zhuangzi, however, I want you to take your reading a little deeper and focus on some key themes. In particular, I want you to keep thinking the figure of the sage. What, exactly, is a sage? What does a sage do? What does a sage think about death? Should a sage get involved with politics? If a ruler is a sage, how would they rule?
      
      Again, I want you to try to avoid the traps of thinking Zhuangzi is either totally confused (yes, he does have a point) or that he is beyond rational analysis. If we’re going to take him seriously as a philosopher, we need to figure out what, exactly, he’s saying.
