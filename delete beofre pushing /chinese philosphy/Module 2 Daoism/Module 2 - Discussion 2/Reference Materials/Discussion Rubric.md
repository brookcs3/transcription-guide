# Discussion Rubric

## General Discussion Rubric

This rubric is applicable for all posts.

Discussion post grades are based primarily on each student’s first, substantive response to the prompt, based on the rubric below. Failure to submit the second post will result in the loss of one point from whatever the grade would have otherwise been. For example, if your substantive post is an 8 but you do not do the second post, you will receive a 7.

- 10: an exception response. The student has analyzed the question in depth and responded with both creativity and nuance. A grade of 10 is reserved for truly exceptional posts.
- 9: a very good response. The student has fulfilled all technical requirements: the post conveys a strong response to the prompt, is well argued, and is grounded in the source material (meaning that the post makes specific reference to the text at hand). This is a very good post, but is not exceptional.
- 8: a very good response. Similar to a 9, but with somewhat less effective argumentation, less nuance, or less effective analysis. Most students who submit full-length responses can anticipate receiving an 8 or 9.
- 7: a good, but not very good response. Such responses may reflect a not fully adequate understanding of the material or the question, or may not contain adequate argumentation.
- 6: not a good response. At this level, there are obvious problems with the response. It may reflect dramatic misunderstanding of the material, to a degree that suggests the student did not read the material at all. It may also simply be far too short, suggesting that even if the student did the reading, they do not care enough to reflect on it or on the prompt.
- 5: inadequate. This is the lowest grade that I will give to a discussion response that is a) turned in on time and b) makes even a modicum of effort. At this level a post may be only a few sentences long and makes it clear that the student did not do the reading.
- 4-1: Grades between 4 and 1 are usually reserved for posts that are late. Each day late results in a loss of one point from the discussion post grade. Thus, a post that is five days late but which would otherwise have been a 9 will result in a grade of 4. Rarely, posts that are extremely inadequate may also receive a grade in this range.
- 0: nothing. If you don’t turn in a discussion response, you will receive a 0. Similarly, if you turn in a response more days late than the grade you would have received, you will receive a 0. Thus, a post that is ten days late, but which would otherwise be worth 9 points will receive a zero.
