## The Integration of Mind and Body in Zhuangzi's Vision of the Sage

So,  Zhuangzi's text this time reveals compelling examples of the mental and physical approaches to "sage hood", and I posit that he ultimately favors an integrated vision where these two different dimensions are inseparable-- rather than alternative approachs. The tension between mental discipline and physical practice resolves in Zhuangzi's understandings that the authentic spiritual transformations must be simultaneously embodied and transcendent.

The mental dimension, he says, of sage-hood appears prominently throughout the texts--particularly in the concept of "fasting of the mind." When Confucius instructs Yen Hui, he emphasizes the moving beyond of ordinary cognition: "Don't listen with your ears, listen with your mind. No, don't listen with your mind, but listen with your spirit... The Way gathers in emptiness alone. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind" (Watson, p. 58). This movement from ears to mind to spirit suggests a totally mental approach to spiritual cultivations. In a similar way,  Yen Hui's philosophy comes through "sitting down and forgetting everything," --- he explains: "I smash up my limbs and body, drive out perception and intellect, cast off form, do away with understanding, and make myself identical with the Great Thoroughfare" (Watson, p. 87). The passages seem to suggest that sage-hood is mostly a matter of mental discipline and the transcendence of ordinary thoughts and thought patterns.

That being said, Zhuangzi consistently stresses that this mental transformation must manifest in a physical embodiment and practice. Thus, The True Man is distinguished in a fundamentally different relationship to his physical existence: "The True Man breathes with his heels; the mass of men breathe with their throats" (Watson, p. 74). This breathing technique that he speaks of represents more than metaphor—it is to suggest that spiritual realization transforms one's entire bodily presence and way of being in the world. Also, there is Zhuangzi's gallery of physically deformed sages(Wang Tai who lost his foot, the ugly Ai T'ai-t'o, and others) demonstrate that true virtue trumps all physical limitations by fully inhabiting the body without attachment. These figures attract followers mainly because their apparance is more than simply how they look-- or even their talents. The combination of both dimensions the culminates in Lieh Tzu's final thought, that he "replaced his wife at the stove, fed the pigs as though he were feeding people, and showed no preferences in the things he did... letting his body stand alone like a clod" (Watson, p. 95). This passage reflects that th ultimate wisdom manifests inthe simple, physical acts of daily life performed with complete presence and non-attachment.

This is in contrast to the privileging of one approach over another-- So, Zhuangzs presents us his idea of sage-hood as requiring both mental emptiness and physical authenticity, where the cultivation of one own inner stillness enables them to fully engage with world while sttill remaining unattached to traditonal judgment or critcisms. Therefore, the sage's mind becomes "like a mirror—going after nothing, welcoming nothing, responding but not storing" (Watson, p. 96),-- however, this mental clarity must be grounded in the lived reality of breathing, eating, working, and relating to others in the physical world.
