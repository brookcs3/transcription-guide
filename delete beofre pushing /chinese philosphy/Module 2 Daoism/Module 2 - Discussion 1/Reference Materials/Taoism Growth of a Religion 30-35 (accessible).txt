For some Taoists, tradition leads them to see this work as containing allusions to longevity practices; for others it is the obscurity of its formulations that gives rise to this opinion. Its most enigmatic expressions have been the selections of choice for interpretations of this type. The "mysterious female" (chap. 6) has been the Heaven-Earth pair that, transposed into terms of breathing techniques, is that of the nose (Heaven) and the mouth (Earth). The expression "embrace the One" (chap. 22) has been used as the name for meditation exercises. Mianmian ruo cun from chapter 6 (meaning "continually-like a thread that unrolls-and constantly") was often cited to illustrate the continued imper.ceptible rhythm that breathing should take. Images like "know the white and hold onto the black" (chap. 28), this "confused thing born before Heaven and the Earth" (chap. 25), "indistinct and vague," in which "there is an image," "a very trustworthy essence" (chap. 21), and many others have evoked for Taoists either special meditation methods or certain phases in ascesis, or even the fun.damental cosmological and anthropological data in their thought. Zhuangzi To Zhuangzi, who probably lived in the fourth century B.c., is at.tributed a work that bears his name and that, as is well known, ranks among the founding texts of Taoism. However, only part of it was probably written by him (the first seven chapters, according to the opinion of most scholars who have studied the matter). The rest was probably written in the third and second centuries B.C. The whole book is quite heterogeneous-a fact that can be ex.plained in part by the writer's or writers' intent to mislead the reader-but it is considered in the Chinese tradition as a whole and has been accepted and studied as such. The version that we have today dates from its most famous commentator, Guo Xiang, who reconstructed and m part emended the original text. It is the only version known by the Chinese since that time, and it is on the basis of this version we shall examine the contributions of the Zhuangzi to Taoism. In order to keep our sights firmly fixed on this perspective, we must set aside some of the most important The Warring States 31 features of this text, one of the richest and most complex ever produced by the Chinese. Zhuangzi takes up where Laozi left off on the themes of unity, serenity, and rejection of the world, but develops, systematizes, and gives them more strength and body. He distinguishes himself from Laozi by a greater tendency to interiorization. Sociopolitical concerns disappear, and non-action no longer has social or politi.cal connotations and becomes purely a state of consciousness. Rather than a dream of a golden age, the theme of unity becomes an aspiration to become one with the moving tide of life. A mysti.cal element integrates and at the same time deepens the dialecti.cal relativism of Laozi. 0 Undoubtedly the image of the Sage is the most important link that ties Zhuangzi to Taoist tradition. The dominant and probably the most characteristic feature of this image is the belief in the existence of beings in human form who are immortal and endowed with supernatural gifts. The Zhuangzi is the oldest extant text that gives us a vivid and precise description of them. Whereas the Sage of Laozi is an immense tutelary and exemplary being to which some brief indications seem to give supernatural powers, in Zhuangzi's work the Sage takes on a whole new dimension, to the point, from our perspective, of constituting a positive pole, com.plementary to the negative pole represented by his whole apo.phatic, critical, and even destructive side. To the questions that Zhuangzi poses and leaves unanswered on the level of discourse and conceptualization, the Sage is the only reply, on another level, in a theological realm. Here again I discuss only those features of the Sage of Zhuangzi that seem to have specifically prefigured and probably inspired the Taoist Sage. An analysis of the texts about the Sage in the Zhuangzi reveals that the Sage is characterized mainly by complete physical and mental freedom: he is outside this world, he wanders freely (you),enjoying himself at the four corners of the universe; he is one with the universe in its mystery of making no response, in his "nature beyond the norm," in the diversity that envelops him so com.pletely that he draws from it an infinite capacity for change and varied responses, without destroying in the least his single, unifying identity. Liberated from all moral, social, or political concerns,all metaphysical uneasiness, all concern for effectiveness,all internal or external conflict, and all wants and desires, his spiritis free and lives in perfect unity with himself and with everything.He thus enjoys a completeness (or "integrity," quan) that gives himgreat power, and he assumes a cosmic dimension. Logically, andunlike the Sage of Laozi, he does not rule, even by non-action. Tolist the descriptive terms most often applied to him, he is One, andthus "alone" (du) and unique, "true" (for, according to Zhuangzi,everything that depends on the external world is artificial), and"heavenly" (tian), a term that also means "natural," as opposed to"human," since man imposes on nature reference marks and toolsthat have a utilitarian quality. He carries in himself his own sourceof life, with which he is one.The description of the Sage given by Zhuangzi in the firstchapters (accepted as the oldest in the book) is probably the earliesttestimony not only to what would become the foundation ofall Taoist hagiographies, but also to what would become one ofthe most powerful sources of the Taoist quest. The Sage rides onthe wind, or the "white clouds." His body never withers: "fire doesnot burn him, and the water does not cover him." Neither hotweather nor frost affect him, neither man nor beast can harmhim (chap. 6; see also chap. 17). In addition, he assumes a cosmicdimension, a fundamental feature of the Sage throughout the historyof Taoism. Zhuangzi gives memorable details about the Sagethat bear witness in a striking fashion to the contemporary existenceof techniques for achieving longevity: "divine men" do noteat the "five cereals," they inhale the wind and sip on the dew,they ride clouds and air, they drive flying dragons and wanderbeyond the four seas.With this final description we come to a new element, taken upat many points in the Zhuangzi, one that would become a characteristicfeature of Taoism: mystic flights. Opening his work withthe magnificent flight of the giant phoenL"X, Zhuangzi alerts usright away that this is an important theme, a key to his whole endeavor.On many occasions, his characters (Zi Qi, Lao Dan [that is,Laozi], Nie Que, chaps. 2, 21, 22) fall into an ecstatic state, leaving their bodies "like dead wood" or "lumps of earth," and their hearts(the seat of both intellectual and affective life) like "burned-outcinders."Zhuangzi provides the mystical element of Taoism, revealed asan integration of the cosmos, unlike the structured system modeledon Yin-Yang and the Five Agents. This integration is workedout by establishing a spatiotemporal pattern based on distinctionsand relations set by the workings of our world. It is an integrationbased on all being. This integration is not formal and objective andreveals itself not through any norms intended to establish andmanifest it externally, but through an overflowing internal feelingthat is the result of meditation and ecstasy. Zhuangzi, in this respect,contributes a fundamental complementary element thatwould almost always be superimposed on the other, more rationalone. The mystical experience that he advocates is, in fact, the resultof practicing the very exercises that he questions, that he seesit necessary to transcend. He is both the glorious, jubilant advocateof the results of these practices and the voice constantly remindingTaoists that they must go beyond them. This would beone of the roles he would fill for them: he represents the "rejection,"the "forgetting" of these practices because he is the culminationthat signals their abolition, and in that role he is alwaysinvoked by the masters as the one who justifies their practices bygoing beyond them.Zhuangzi saw two principles as the basis of life, and they wouldhave the same importance to the Taoists, as is shown in theirshared view of vital mechanics. These basic elements are breath(qi) and "essence" (Jing). Zhuangzi was the first who wrote that"life is a concentration of breath; when it concentrates itself, thatis life, and when it disperses, that is death," a sentence repeatedconstantly by authors who often seem to have forgotten its source.This qi, this "breath," neither matter nor spirit, sole substance ofthe world, is the Primordial Breath of the Taoists, the object ofmost of their techniques for achieving longevity. The other elementis jing, a term that would later take on various meanings; fornow we may simply recall that Zhuangzi on many occasions insistedthat in it is "the root of the body," (chap. 22), that "the Sageputs a high value on it," and that it must be kept "intact andwhole" and must not "be agitated" (chap. 15).Zhuangzi often stressed the quietism preached by Laozi: silenceplus absence of thought. This is how Guang Chengzi advisedthe Yellow Emperor: "Do not look, do not listen, embrace yourspirits in quietude, and your body will be correct of its own accord;be calm, be pure, do not exhaust your body, do not stir up your essence,and you will be able to live long; if your eyes see nothing, ifyour ears hear nothing, if your heart/mind knows nothing, yourspirits will preserve your body, and your body will live long; takecare of your interior, shut yourself off from the exterior; too muchknowledge leads to destruction" (chap. 11; in Chinese thought, theheart was always the seat of both thought and emotions). The"heart/mind fast" ("Let your will be one; do not listen with yourears but with your heart/mind; do not listen with your heart butwith your breath" [chap. 4]), the metaphor of the pure and undisturbed"mirror of the heart" (chap. 2) that can reflect the wholeworld in its entirety without distortion, "seated meditation" (zuowang;literally "sit and forget") in which one "abandons his bodyand its parts, rejects perceptual sharpness, leaves his form, drivesaway his knowledge, and becomes one with the Universal Greatness"(chap. 6)-these are also lessons that the Taoists wouldvalue highly.The "heart/mind fast" is a corollary to a formula that Zhuangzipicked up from Laozi: "preserve the One." This became a key termin Taoism for various meditation techniques. Once again, GuangChengzi taught this lesson to the Yellow Emperor: "I preserve theOne," he said, "and remain in Harmony; thus I was able to reachthe age of 1200 years" (chap. 11). And again Laozi replied to Confuciuswhen asked how he entered an ecstatic state: "Achieve theOne and identify yourself with it" (chap. 12). Bi Yi, echoing him,taught Nie Que, who immediately fell into ecstasy: "Let your bodybe right, your contemplation one, and Celestial Harmony will arrive;gather in your knowledge; let your acts be one, and the spiritswill come into your dwelling" (chap. 22). We already have here, asin other passages of the Zhuangzi, all the principles of later Taoistcontemplation: the "correct body" (zheng), which suggests a bodythat is both healthy and in the correct position for meditation, andthe "coming of the spirits into the dwelling," which reminds us ofthe appearance of divine spirits, either in the meditation room orin the body of the Taoist, their "dwelling."All this corresponds to the attitude of concentration and shuttingout of the exterior world, the world of the senses-an act ofretirement and breaking off that, in fact, is only the complementand preliminary state of the movement outward that opens ontothe holy state of rejoicing in a continuous universe where there isno longer any interior or exterior. The closing of the world of thesenses is a closing of the narrow world of the individual, the worldlimited by his sensory perceptions and his own thoughts, but atthe same time an opening to cosmic unity through the cosmic"breath" ("do not listen with your ears, nor with your heart andmind, xin, but with the 'breath'"). Here are all the fundamentals ofTaoist meditation.Neglected during the Han, the Zhuangzi returned to high esteemduring the third and fourth centuries A.D., especially once theChinese had been brought face to face with Buddhist speculations.Zhuangzi has an important place within Taoism from the fourthcentury on: Ge Hong refers to him often as do, later, the Shangqingand other Taoist texts.The "Chuci," the Wu, and the Fangs hiThe Chuci and Ecstatic JourneysSome of the features characteristic of Zhuangzi can be seen in anothermovement with which he shares certain affinities, to thepoint that it is possible and even probable that Zhuangzi is onlythe visible member of a once widespread movement that has leftfew traces; this other movement is that of the Chuci, the "Songs ofChu," which are our main evidence for its existence.2These elegies, a group of poems dating from the third and secondcenturies B.c., are the product of the "shamanism" of thesouth of China, which possessed an autonomous culture; they reveala form of religion quite different from that of northern China.The central individual is not the sovereign, or the head of the fam
