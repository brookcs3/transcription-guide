- - ## Introduction to Daoism Part 1
  
    Having looked at early Confucian ideas, we now turn our attention to the other pillar of early Chinese thought: Daoism. [Remember that Dao and Tao are two ways to spell the same thing, and are pronounced exactly the same. See my discussion of transliterating Chinese [here](https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/2006769/pages/preliminary-pronouncing-chinese-words-wade-giles-vs-pinyin) if you’re confused.] The most famous early Daoist is probably Laozi. But Laozi’s writings, compiled in the *Dao De Jing*, are dense and difficult to understand, making them hard to use in an online course such as this one. Instead, we will be looking at the writings of another early Daoist: Zhuangzi.
  
    Like Laozi, Zhuangzi focusses on understanding the dao, often translated as “the way.” So when you read this text, keep thinking about what is this dao that Zhuangzi speaks of? Is it a real thing? A metaphor? Something else? Perhaps more importantly, how should a human being relate to the dao? It’s clear that one should follow the dao, but what does that even mean?
  
    When reading Zhuangzi (and even more so Laozi) it is easy to either feel lost, like it doesn’t make any sense, or to get so caught up in the image of a wandering sage in touch with the way that we lose critical perspective. Try to avoid both extremes. Zhuangzi creates some beautiful images, but try to remain focused on what, exactly, he’s actually saying.

    After successful completion of this module, you will be able to:
  
    - Recall the details of basic Daoist philosophy, especially the idea of the *dao*.
