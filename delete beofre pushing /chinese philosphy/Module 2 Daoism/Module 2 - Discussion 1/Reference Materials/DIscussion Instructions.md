## Topic

Like Confucius, Zhuangzi sees human society as deeply flawed, but his assessment of the problem is very different. For Zhuangzi, where did humans go wrong? What is the root of the problems in human society?

After discussing the “problem” that Zhuangzi sees, I want you to also discuss his proposed solution. That is, how should a person fix the problem?

Finally, I want you to reflect on all of this and then let me know if you think this is at all practical. In your own opinion, is Zhuangzi pointing to a lifestyle that is at all realistic, or is this so far out there that it doesn’t even warrant consideration.

## Instructions

Each day, students should write two discussion posts.

The first is a response to the primary prompt. As the rubric (below) makes clear, these discussion posts should be substantial. Generally speaking, they should be *two to three paragraphs long*, and should delve into and develop one or more specific arguments. Simply paraphrasing or repeating the ideas found in the reading is not sufficient. Your posts should contain your own critical analysis of that material, guided by the question asked in the prompt. Note that you will not be able to see other students’ posts until you have uploaded your own.

The second post is a thoughtful response to another student’s post. This second post does not need to be as substantial as the first post. A short paragraph is sufficient, though you should say more than “Good point!” Please take the time to read and reflect on how other students replied to the prompt. It is fine to disagree with another student’s analysis, but please make sure that you remain respectful even when you make critical comments.
