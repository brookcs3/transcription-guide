# Response to Theone Slabinski

Hey Theone, I love how you’ve linked Zhuangzi to the 1960s counterculture. There are some cool connections there that are definitely worth exploring further. I think Zhuangzi’s ideas might be more nuanced than just a simple ‘don’t worry, be happy’ message. You’re right that completely leaving society isn’t realistic, but maybe Zhuangzi is pointing to something deeper than just withdrawing. When he mentions wu-wei or ‘freeing yourself from the world,’ it could mean adopting a mental mindset rather than physically escaping—acting without being attached to outcomes instead of avoiding action altogether. Your take on the nihilistic elements is intriguing, but I view Zhuangzi as more life-affirming; he seems to celebrate the natural flow of life rather than ignoring its significance. The Cook Ting story illustrates how we can engage fully in practical tasks while finding spiritual freedom through skill and naturalness. So perhaps the real takeaway isn’t about everyone becoming hermits, but about approaching our essential social roles with less rigid attachment to traditional notions of success and failure.
