- - - - ## Introduction to Daoism Part 3
  
        The reading for this short module was not written by Zhuangzi, Laozi, or any other ancient Chinese sage. Instead, it is by the contemporary scholar Hans-Georg Moeller. Moeller argues that Daoism offers a philosophical vision that is fundamentally non-humanist, meaning that it does not assume that humans are at the center of things. By being non-humanist, Moeller suggests, Daoists offer a philosophical vision that is radically different from what most of us have grown up assuming about the world. Most of us who have grown up in Europe or the US share a set of ideals that are grounded in enlightenment philosophyâ€”which was itself was grounded on Christian ideas about the superiority of humans over the rest of creation. Moeller suggests that Daoism offers a powerful critique of those ideas, one that Moeller himself is not sure he agrees with.
        
        As you read, I want you to think about the argument Moeller is making and whether you agree with him or not. If you agree that Daoism offers a radically different vision of the world, then do you think this is a good thing?
        
        It is worth noting that Moeller draws mostly on Laozi and his Dao De Jing. Do not be dismayed by this, however: his arguments apply equally well to Zhuangzi.
