# Response to Theone Slabinski

Theone, your point about Daoism being potentially condescending really resonates with me - that comparison to telling someone in grief to "just move on" captures something troubling about how non-humanist philosophy can come across in practice. I think you've identified a genuine tension: while Moeller presents Daoist non-humanism as offering humility, it can easily slide into a kind of spiritual superiority that dismisses real human suffering. Your phrase "stop humaning" is particularly apt because it suggests that the very qualities that make us recognizably human—our judgments, attachments, and emotional responses—are treated as problems to be transcended rather than aspects of existence to be understood or worked with compassionately. However, I wonder if there might be a distinction between dismissing human experience and offering a different framework for relating to it? When I think about the Daoist sage being "without human impulses," I'm not sure it necessarily means becoming inhuman so much as finding a way to respond to life's difficulties without being overwhelmed by the reactive patterns that often make suffering worse. But you're absolutely right that this can feel like philosophical bypass when applied to real situations where people need genuine support and practical help rather than abstract wisdom about cosmic indifference.
