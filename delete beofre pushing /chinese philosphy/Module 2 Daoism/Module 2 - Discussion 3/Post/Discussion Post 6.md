## Embracing the Uncomfortable Truth: Moeller's Non-Humanist Daoism as Necessary Humility

I find Moeller's characterization of Daoism as fundamentally non-humanist both compelling and deeply unsettling—which may be precisely why it deserves serious consideration. His argument that Daoist philosophy refuses to place humans at the center of reality, embodied in the image of heaven and earth treating all things as "straw dogs," challenges core assumptions that permeate Western thought (Moeller, p. 131). The Daoist sage, as Moeller explains, achieves wisdom not through heightened human faculties but by transcending "human impulses" (qing)—those judgmental attitudes of approval and disapproval that constitute our distinctly human way of being in the world (Moeller, p. 134). This vision presents humans as merely one component within larger cosmic processes rather than the privileged agents of history and meaning we typically imagine ourselves to be.

While I agree with Moeller's analysis of Daoism's non-humanist character, I find this philosophical stance simultaneously frustrating and necessary. It is frustrating because it undermines cherished notions of human dignity, individual agency, and moral progress that feel essential to meaningful existence. The idea that society should function through the ruler's "non-action" rather than purposeful human intervention runs counter to our deepest intuitions about social justice and political responsibility (Moeller, p. 144). Yet this frustration may itself reveal the very human vanity that Daoist non-humanism seeks to address. Moeller's comparison to post-modern thinkers like Foucault, who predicted the eventual "erasure" of the modern concept of man, suggests that our humanist self-descriptions may be historically contingent rather than eternal truths (Moeller, p. 142). The Daoist refusal to grant humans special cosmic status offers what Moeller calls "a more sincere and modest self-description"—one that acknowledges not only what humans can do but what they cannot and perhaps should not pretend to do (Moeller, p. 145).

Ultimately, I find Moeller's non-humanist Daoism appealing not because it offers comfort, but because it provides necessary humility in an age of ecological crisis and technological overreach. The pre-humanist wisdom of accepting our embeddedness within rather than dominion over natural processes may offer insights more relevant than ever. While I cannot fully embrace the political implications of wu wei governance, the psychological and ethical dimensions of overcoming judgmental impulses and anthropocentric thinking strike me as profound spiritual practices. Perhaps the true value of Daoist non-humanism lies not in its literal application but in its capacity to deflate human pretensions and redirect our attention toward the larger patterns of existence that sustain us—a philosophical corrective to the humanist hubris that has created many of our contemporary problems.
